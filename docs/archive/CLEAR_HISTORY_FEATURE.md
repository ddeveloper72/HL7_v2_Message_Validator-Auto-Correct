# Clear History Feature - User Guide

## Overview
Added bulk deletion functionality to quickly remove all validation history records instead of deleting them one by one.

## New Features

**Location**: Dashboard, next to "Show All Sessions" button

**What it does**: 
- Deletes ALL your validation records from the database

- Resets statistics to zero
- **Cannot be undone!**

**How to use**:
1. Go to Dashboard
2. Click "Clear All History" button (red trash icon)
3. Confirm the warning dialog
4. All records deleted instantly

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Warning**: Clearing history is PERMANENT and cannot be undone!

💡 **Tip**: If you only want to remove a few records, use single deletion instead

🔒 **Privacy**: Only YOU can see and delete YOUR records

📊 **Statistics**: After clearing, your stats reset to zero

## Deployment

The feature is ready to deploy:
