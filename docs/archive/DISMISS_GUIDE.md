# How to Dismiss Reports - Quick Guide

##  Both Features Are Now Working!

### Feature 1: Dismiss Individual Reports

**Where to find it:**
- Look at any validation report card in your dashboard
- At the bottom of each card, you'll see action buttons
- The **"Dismiss"** button has an  icon

**How to use:**
1. Click the "Dismiss" button on any report
2. Confirm the popup dialog
3. Report is deleted from your history

**Works for:**
-  Database reports (db_XXX)
-  Temp session reports
-  Only YOUR reports (security protected)

---

### Feature 2: Clear ALL History at Once

**Where to find it:**
- Top right of the "Validation Reports" section
- Next to the "Show All Sessions" button
- Red button that says **"Clear All History"** with  icon

**Important:** Only shows if you have reports!

**How to use:**
1. Click "Clear All History" button (top right)
2. Read the warning ( permanent action!)
3. Click OK to confirm
4. All your reports deleted instantly

**What it deletes:**
-  ALL validation records from database
-  ALL temp session records
-  Resets statistics to zero
-  CANNOT be undone!

## Quick Troubleshooting

### "I don't see the Clear All History button"
**Reason:** You have 0 reports (button only shows when you have reports)
**Solution:** Upload and validate a file first

### "Dismiss button doesn't work"
**Check:**
1. Are you logged in?
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Make sure you have reports visible

### "Getting 404 or 403 errors"
**Reason:** Security protection or report not found
**Solution:**
- Make sure you own the report
- Refresh the page to reload reports
- Check you're logged in with correct account

## What Happens When You Delete

### Single Dismiss:
```
Before: 10 reports shown
Action: Click dismiss on 1 report
After:  9 reports shown (page reloads)
```

### Clear All:
```
Before: 10 reports shown
Action: Click "Clear All History" → Confirm
After:  0 reports, statistics reset to 0
```

## Testing It Locally

Start your Flask app:
```bash
python run_local_test.py
```

Or manually:
```bash
C:/Users/Duncan/VS_Code_Projects/HL7_v2_Message_Validator-Auto-Correct/.venv/Scripts/python.exe dashboard_app.py
```

Then:
1. Go to http://localhost:5000
2. Login
3. Upload a test file
4. See the "Clear All History" button appear
5. Each report card has a "Dismiss" button

## Backend Routes (For Reference)

### Individual Delete:
```
POST /delete-report/<report_id>
- Handles: db_XXX (database) and session reports
- Security: Login required, ownership verified
```

### Bulk Delete:
```
POST /clear-history
- Deletes ALL user's reports
- Security: Login required, rate limited (5/min)
- Returns: Count of deleted records
```

## Ready to Deploy?

Both features are tested and working! Deploy when ready:

git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Dismiss reports works for database records + bulk clear"
git push heroku main
```

## Need Help?

If dismiss still doesn't work:
1. Check browser console (F12 → Console tab)
2. Look for JavaScript errors
3. Check network tab for failed requests
4. Verify you're logged in
5. Try refreshing the page

The backend tests all pass , so it's working correctly!
